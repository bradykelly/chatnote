# stenobot
I created Stenobot to allow a Discord member to quickly take notes while chatting. 
I always found myself rushing to make notes on /in text files and or paper, and then losing the notes. 

Design and implementation of the bot were inspired by this video tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYeOw6sTSy6ZGyygcbta7GcpI8a5-Cooc

The Stenobot bot will help you very simply and quickly add a note to your Stenobot notebook, and you can't lose this notebook.

This bot is still in development so please forgive, but don't forget to report, any bugs or anomalies. Please DM me on Discord or twitter.
