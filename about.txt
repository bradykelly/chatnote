I created ChatNote to allow a Discord user to quickly take notes while chatting. 
I always found myself rushing to make notes on /in text files and or paper, and then losing the notes. 

The ChatNote bot will help you very simply and quickly add a note to your ChatNote notebook, and you can't lose this notebook.

This bot is still in development so please forgive, but don't forget to report, any bugs or anomalies. Please DM me on Discord or twitter.
